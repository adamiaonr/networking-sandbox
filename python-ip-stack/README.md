# python-ip-stack

An user-level TCP/IP stack built with Python. This is an experimental and 
educational project, with 2 main objectives:

* Brush up knowledge about the different protocols in the TCP/IP stack
* Learn more about the Python language, which seems to be quite versatile and 
easy to apply to different problems. The main focus is learning Python's 
tools for networking (e.g. [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/), 
[pytun](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pytun/2.2.1), etc.).

This work is based on the work of saminiir@gmail.com, who coded 
a minimal TCP/IP stack from scratch in C (check [saminirr's Github](https://github.com/saminiir/level-ip)).
